Sequential Promises

Sequential = One thing after another, in order.

A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents a value youâ€™ll get in the future (after an async operation finishes).

ðŸ§© Putting it Together: Sequential Promises
Say you want to:

Fetch user

Then fetch userâ€™s posts

Then fetch comments on the first post

You must do it in order, because the next step depends on the previous:

```js
async function runSequential() {
  const user = await fetchUser();          // must wait
  const posts = await fetchPosts(user.id); // depends on user
  const comments = await fetchComments(posts[0].id); // depends on posts
}
